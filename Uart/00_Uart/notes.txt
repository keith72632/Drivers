Uart Notes
Uart Peripheral Clock:
    All uart runs at 16MHz, due to occilator
Shift rergisters are used to transer bits into words
Steps to set up Data Transmission
    1. Set the M bit in USART_CR1 to define word length(8 or 9 bits)
    2.Program the number of stop bits in USART_CR2 register
    3.Select the desired baud rate 
    4.Set the TE bit in USART_CR1 to enable transmit block
    5.Enable USART by writing the UE bit in the USART_CR1
    6.If the txe flag is set, then write the data byte to the usart_dr register. 
    7. After writing the last data into the usart_dr, wait unti tc = 1
Uart Reciver
    1.program the M bit for word length
    2.program the desired baud rate in brr
    3. Enable the usart with the UE bit
    4.Set the re bit in the usart_cr1 register, which enable the reciever block
    5.When a character is recieved, wait until the rxne bit is set and read the data byte
    6.The rxne bit must be cleard by reading the data register, before the end of reception 
        of the next character to avoid overrun error
