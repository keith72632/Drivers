What is SPI?
    Serial Peripheral Interface, used to commuincate with master and slave devices. Other transfer protocols are I2P,
usba  and ethernet. The pins that use SPI are the MISO pins(Master in and out), the MOSI pin(master out/slave in), SCK( Serial
clock). These pins will be syncronized with the PCK. SS stands for slave select. Used to select and individual slave
device. Thse miso and mosi are used to communicate between slaves and masters. SPI allows higher speeds. I2C is much
slower but more complex and can span larger distances. RS-232 and RS-485 can reach much further distances. 

Importance of slave pin select:
    Master must support SPI protocol. To use, the master must first select the slave's ss pin. Unless the ss is pulled
to 0 or ground, Master won't be able to access the slave. The SCLK must be sent along with the data. Slave's data
communication lines(MISO and MOSI) will be in HI-Z state or high dependence state until ss line is pulled to ground.
So, to activate the slave's miso and mosi lines, ss must be pulled to ground. 

Minimal SPI bus configuartion:
    The SPI bus allows the communication between one master and multiple slaves. In some application, the SPI bus may 
consist of only two wires-one for the clock signal and the other for synchronous data transfer. This method is used when
master isn't expecting a signal FROM slave, only sending to slave. SS would be programed to zero in this instance. 

SPI behind the scenes operations:
    Uses a shift register. 8 Master and slave have 8 bit registers. Sending SCLK initializes shift register. Each clock
cycle, shift registers shift one bit. last bit in slave shift is tranfers to this first bit in slave shift register. When
master sends data, it always recieved data. If 0 bit is sent to slave, slave shift is right shifted one bit, and last
slave bit is tranfers to first master bit.
